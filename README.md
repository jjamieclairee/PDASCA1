Preface
Research Question: How do salaries for different work types vary by location and job role, and what is the impact of job popularity on salary trends across regions?
In the fast-evolving world of technology, understanding job market trends is essential, not only for employers seeking top talent but also for individuals planning their careers. As a computing student, Alexâ€™s unexpected discovery of a thumb drive containing job listings and company insights offers a unique opportunity to uncover valuable data that could shape career decisions. Through careful analysis of this dataset, Alex aims to gain insights into salary trends, job roles, and location-based disparities, ultimately contributing to better-informed decisions about career planning and business strategy.

Background
With the vast amount of data available online, the job market can seem overwhelming and opaque. However, analyzing datasets that include job listings and company insights can provide clarity, particularly when it comes to understanding how salaries are influenced by factors like work type (e.g., remote, in-office, hybrid), job role, and location. Additionally, insights into job popularity, reflected by views and applications, may offer key information about how the demand for certain roles varies by region and work type.

In this context, understanding the interplay between salary and job role/location/popularity is critical for both employers and employees. For employers, it helps in setting competitive compensation packages and refining recruitment strategies. For employees, it provides valuable guidance when making career decisions, especially when deciding between roles, industries, or locations.

Primary Objectives: 
The primary objectives of this research are to:
1. Analyze salary trends across different job roles and work types (e.g., remote, hybrid, in-office) to understand how they vary by location.
2. Investigate the impact of job popularity (as indicated by views and applications) on salary trends, specifically how highly viewed and applied-for positions correlate with higher or lower salaries.
3. Identify regional salary disparities, focusing on how different geographic areas (cities or countries) affect compensation for various job roles and work types.
4. Provide actionable insights that could assist students, like Alex, in understanding how to optimize their career paths, considering factors such as location, role, and work flexibility.

By addressing these objectives, the analysis will not only offer insights into the current job market dynamics but also provide useful recommendations for both job seekers and businesses looking to attract top talent.
